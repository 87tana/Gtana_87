### [Exploring CNN Components for Tumor Segmentation in MRI Images: An Ablation Study](https://github.com/87tana/Image-Semantic-Segmentation)  

#### Summary:

In this project, I investigate how different components of a convolutional neural network (CNN) affect its performance in image segmentation tasks. I compare the effectiveness of two different architectures and investigate how data augmentation and optimisation strategies affect the results. 

My experiments show that ResNet is more effective than the VGG architecture, and that using dilated convolutions improves segmentation results. In addition, data augmentation increases the model's ability to generalise. 
I got about a 10% improvement in segmentation results over the baseline model.
