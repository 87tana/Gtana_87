##### Summary:

* Investigate different components of a convolutional neural network (CNN) affect performance in image segmentation tasks.
* Compare the effectiveness of two different architectures.(ResNet-18, VGG-16)
* Investigate the impact of different data augmentation (Elastic, Affine), Loss Function(BCE, Dice) and other optimization strategies on results.
* Experiments show:
  * ResNet-18 is more effective than the VGG-16 architecture.
  * Using dilated convolutions improves segmentation results.
  * Data augmentation increases the model's ability to generalize.
  * Achieved about a 10% improvement in segmentation results over the baseline model.
